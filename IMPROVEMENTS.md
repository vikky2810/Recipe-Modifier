# Improvement List
- [ ] Allow a patient to have multiple medical conditions at the same time.
- [X] Disable the report-download option when the patient isn’t logged in.
- [X] Fix the system date issue (it shows an old timestamp like AM instead of the current one).
- [X] Improve allergy handling. If a user has an egg allergy and selects an omelette, the system shouldn’t say the ingredient is safe.
- [ ] Add a field for custom instructions. If the user is missing ingredients, the recipe should adapt and regenerate without them.
- [ ] Strengthen username and email validation.
- [ ] When generating a report, show only the current entry, not previous ones. Keep the report structured and clean.
- [ ] Improve the UI.
- [ ] Calorie calculation for obesity should consider ingredient quantities, not just the ingredient list.
- [ ] Reduce response time.
- [ ] Include the dish image at the top of the recipe instructions.
- [ ] Add recipe feedback and the option to regenerate the recipe.
